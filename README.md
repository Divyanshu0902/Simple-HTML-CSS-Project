# A Minimalistic Landing Page

![](/images/Webpage_Preview.png)

>This is a simple minimalistic **Landing Page** for an imaginary e-Commerce brand.
---
Here are some details about the project :
- I have used **vanilla HTML and CSS** to create this simple and minimalistic project. 
- It contains a Hero's section, with a rich vector image on the right while on the left it contains the main title and supporting text beneth.
- below the supporting text, there is a bright attention grabbing CTA (Call to Action Button) also accompanied by a similar less visible button on its right.
- At the top, it contains a navbar with several sections for different varieties of products

- a bright visible CTA is also provided in the navbar on the right side. (Multiple CTA buttons increase the chances of a visitor converting into client.)
---
- Due care has been taken to adhere to the **fundamental principles of Web Designing like :**
    - Consistency in **Colour Scheme**
    - Consistency in **Font size, family and weight**
    - **Hierarchy** of elements
    - appropriate use of **Whitespaces**
